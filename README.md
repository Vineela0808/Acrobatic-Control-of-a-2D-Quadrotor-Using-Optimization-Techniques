ROB 6323 Reinforcement Learning and Optimal Control for Robotics || Project - SQP &amp; MPC || Fall 2024

## Abstract
This project presents a control strategy for a 2D quadrotor performing acrobatic maneuvers using Sequential Quadratic Programming(SQP) solver. The quadrotor's motion is governed by a nonlinear dynamic model, where thrust forces from two rotors determine its position and orientation. The objective is to design an optimal control strategy that enables precise and efficient trajectory tracking while considering dynamic constraints. The SQP solver is utilized to compute the optimal control inputs at each time step, ensuring smooth and stable quadrotor motion. The proposed approach is validated through simulation, demonstrating its effectiveness in executing complex maneuvers while maintaining stability.
